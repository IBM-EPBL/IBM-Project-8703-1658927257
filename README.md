Gas Leakage monitoring Alerting system for Industries:   
                True prevention is not waiting for bad things to happen, it's preventing things from happening in the first place. Installing the proposed system will be one of the best ways to prevent accident. An industry that values employeeâ€™s life will always grow faster. This system can detect even a slightest leak in the entire system so not only you can prevent disasters but also you can efficiently track whether the gas is being used or being wasted due to leakage.
